This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The core framework providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and route handling.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and enhancing developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for the database (Firestore) to store and manage food items.
- **Vercel**: For deploying and hosting the application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
